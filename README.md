## üöÄ Quick Start Options

Choose the setup method that suits you best:

---

### üåê Option 1: Snapchat Web or Microsoft Store App (Simple & Accessible)

1. **Download this script**  
   Clone the repo or [download it as ZIP](https://github.com/FlazeIGuess/SnapscoreBoosterPlus/releases/tag/Release) and extract it.

2. **Install Python 3.9**  
   [Download for Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe)  
   During setup, make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"**.

3. **Install Python dependencies**  
   Double-click `Install Requirements.bat` or run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the script folder.

4. **Choose your Snapchat platform**:
   - **Snapchat Web**: Go to [web.snapchat.com](https://web.snapchat.com/), log in, and leave the window open.
   - **Microsoft Store App**: Install Snapchat from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/snapchat/9NL4J1B0Q61N).

5. **Run the script**  
   Launch `run.bat` or run `python main.py`.

6. **Calibrate mouse positions**  
   Hover the cursor over the required buttons in the Snapchat interface (Camera, Snap, Send To, etc.) and press **F** to save each position.

7. **Follow the prompts**  
   Enter the number of recipients, timing preferences, and begin boosting your Snapscore.
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Calibration may need to be adjusted manually due to UI differences.
   Recommendation:
   - Because Snapchat web doesn't have an extra Chat site just use the first and second calibration on the shutter button, everything else should be the same as Android.
   

These alternatives are easier to set up than emulators and work well for simple Snapscore automation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice: Emulator Use is Unstable

Using Snapchat inside Android emulators like BlueStacks, NoxPlayer, or LDPlayer is **highly unreliable**. Snapchat actively detects and restricts virtual devices. Expect:
- Login errors
- Black screens
- App crashes

For best results, use a real Android phone.

1. **Download this script** (see Option 2)

2. **Install Python 3.9** and dependencies  
   Use `Install Requirements.bat` or run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Install an Android emulator**  
   e.g. [NoxPlayer](https://www.bignox.com/) or [LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/)

4. **Install and log in to Snapchat** inside the emulator

5. **Create a Snapchat Shortcut** with the recipients you want to automate

6. **Run the script**  
   Launch `run.bat` or run `python main.py`

7. **Follow the same calibration process** as described in Option 2
